I'm a Research Scientist at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I obtained my PhD from Columbia University. I am broadly interested in the intersection of HCI, AI/ML, and AR/VR, with a special focus on leveraging AI/ML to develop novel interaction techniques. I aim to develop techniques that bridge the digital and physical worlds, fostering a more integrated and intuitive user experience. I have also worked on developing trustworth ML models that can resist adversarial data.  I am a recipient of the [Snap Research Fellowship (2019)](https://research.snap.com/fellowships.html) and the [Cheung-Kong Innovation Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/2020/students-with-fellowships-2020/).

I'm always on the lookout for interns and collaborators. If you're interested in my research and would like to collaborate, please send me an email.
