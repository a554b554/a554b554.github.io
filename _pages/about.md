I'm a Research Scientist at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I obtained my PhD from Columbia University. I am broadly interested in the intersection of HCI, AI/ML, and AR/VR, with a special focus on leveraging AI/ML to develop novel interaction techniques. I aim to develop techniques that bridge the digital and physical worlds, fostering a more integrated and intuitive user experience. I have also worked on developing trustworthy ML models.  I am a recipient of the [Snap Research Fellowship (2019)](https://research.snap.com/fellowships.html) and the [Cheung-Kong Innovation Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/2020/students-with-fellowships-2020/).

My research outcomes have an impact beyond academia. At Adobe, my research on new AR shopping experiences has been presented at Adobe’s [Summit Sneaks 2022](https://business.adobe.com/summit/2022/sessions/project-right-sized-mb9-3.html). This feature has also been integrated into Adobe Commerce’s product, the [AR Viewer](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/magento-module-arviewer.html), where I lead the research and development. My past work has received more than 50 media interviews and coverages, including by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/26/tech/snap-smartphone-buttons-knobs/index.html), [Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/commerce/adobe-unveils-new-augmented-reality-shopping-tool-prototype/), [CACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/260184-magnetic-snoops-plunder-deep-learnings-secrets/fulltext/), and [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/hiding-information-in-plain-text). I also hold 8 US patents.

I'm always on the lookout for interns and collaborators. If you're interested in my research and would like to collaborate, please send me an email.
