I'm a Research Scientist at Adobe Research. I obtained my PhD from Columbia University. I am broadly interested in the intersection of HCI, AI/ML, and AR/VR, with a special focus on leveraging AI/ML to develop novel interaction techniques. I aim to develop techniques that bridge the digital and physical worlds, fostering a more integrated and intuitive user experience. I have also worked on developing trustworth ML models that can resist adversarial data. Prior to my PhD, I earned my bachelor's degree from the College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University. I am a recipient of the Snap Research Fellowship and the Cheung-Kong Innovation Doctoral Fellowship. I'm always on the lookout for interns and collaborators. If you're interested in my research and would like to collaborate, please send me an email.
